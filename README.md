# Navigation Bar Learning - Day 9

## Overview
On Day 9, I focused on clearing my doubts related to the navigation bar section in HTML. I improved my understanding of:
- Structuring a navigation bar inside the `<header>` tag  
- Properly linking pages using the `<a>` tag  
- Making the navbar responsive for different screen sizes  

## Key Takeaways
- Better understanding of HTML structure for navigation  
- Improved page linking using anchor (`<a>`) tags  
- Learned about styling and positioning navbars with CSS  

## Future Enhancements
- Adding a dropdown menu for better user experience  
- Implementing a sticky/fixed navbar  
- Enhancing interactivity using JavaScript
