# Intern-day-9
"On Day 9 of my internship, I focused on clearing doubts related to the navigation bar in HTML. I improved my understanding of structuring a &lt;nav> inside the &lt;header> tag, linking pages correctly, and making the navbar responsive. This learning day helped strengthen my HTML and CSS fundamentals for better website navigation design."
